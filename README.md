# OpenSidewalksDashboard Project
This is a group project I'm working on in the University of Washington Computer Science and Engineering department in Winter 2018. The dashboard uses data from the Seattle government to analyze the sidewalk issues around Seattle. 

# Setup
- Download and install Node.js
- Download react: `npm install --save react`
- Download a command line tool to create a new react application, run: `npm install -g create-react-app`
- Download react router dom - it enables client-side URL routing: `npm install --save react-router-dom`

# Running the app
- Once everything is installed, switch into the app directory: `OpenPedDataPortal/dashboard`
- Run: `npm start` -- opens a new tab with the app in the default browser
